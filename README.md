This is a simple slideshow built with React and Redux utilizing the Nuka-Carousel package from
npm.

When the project initialized, an Ajax call is made through Axios which obtains all the photo URLs and data from the API endpoint. After obtaining this data, the Slideshow component renders to the screen, and a map function is used to iterate over the data and compile it into Nuka-Carousel. The Carousel allows users to easily slide from one photo to the next.
